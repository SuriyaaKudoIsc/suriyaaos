## What kind of OS is suriyaaOS built?

The goal is to build a very simple [UNIX][unix]-based operating	system in C++, not just	a "proof-of-concept". The OS should be able to boot, start a userland shell, and be extensible.

The OS will be built for the x86 architecture, running on 32 bits, and compatible with IBM PCs. It also works as a virtual machine nearly on all similar computers like [Windows][win], [Mac][mac] & [Linux][lin].


## Specifications & Features

 * Code in C++
 * x86-architecture -> 32-bits
 * Boot with (GNU) Grub
 * Kind of modular system for drivers (it's not really great)
 * Kind of UNIX style (again: It's not great)
 * Multitasking
 * ELF executable in userland (-> kernel.elf)
 * Modules (accessible in userland using /suriyaa/...):
	* IDE disks
	* DOS partitions
	* Clock
	* EXT2 (read only)
	* Boch VBE
 * Userland:
	* API Posix
	* LibC
	* "Can" run a shell or some excutables like [Lua][lua], ...
 * Supports [ASCII][ascii] and [OSCII][oscii] [8][oscii8] standard scheme


## Prerequisites

### For a Physical Machine

Buy or build a computer using x86 architecture. It should be compatible with IBM PCs.

### For a Virtual Machine

You will need [Vagrant][vagrant] and [VirtualBox][oraclevm] or [QEMU][qemu] installed. Read the [`INSTALL.md`][install] file.
